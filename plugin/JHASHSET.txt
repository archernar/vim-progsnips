 * HashSet doesn’t maintain any order, the elements would be returned in any random order.
 * HashSet doesn’t allow duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate element in HashSet,
 * the old value would be overwritten.
 * HashSet allows null values however if you insert more than one nulls it would still
 * return only one null value.
 * HashSet is non-synchronized.
 * The iterator returned by this class is fail-fast which means iterator
 * would throw ConcurrentModificationException
 * if HashSet has been modified after creation of iterator, 
 * by any means except iterator’s own remove method.
