/* CS 0401 Fall 2018 Java Example 5c (compare to Example 5a)
   This handout will also read in some scores from a user and then determine the
   average.

   In this version, the user knows how many scores there are and the number of
   scores is read in initially.  However, rather than a while loop, which was used
   in ex5a, we are using a for loop.

   I have also included a do-while loop, to show a use for that control structure,
   and to show an alternative way of ensuring data in the correct range.  Note
   that ex5a has a single loop, with the count only being incremented if the data
   is correct.  Thus, the loop could execute more than numItems times.

   In this version, the outer loop will execute exactly numItems times.  Incorrect
   data is handled by an inner do-while loop, which iterates until the data is
   correct.

				// in ex5a.  In ex5a, we were testing to see if the data
				// was valid, while here we are testing to see if it is
				// NOT valid.  Thus the conditions are the opposite of
				// each other.  By DeMorgan's Law,
				// !(A && B) == (!A) || (!B)
